		<p>Mansion is a free multimedia theme for WordPress. The theme design was developed with users who appreciate visual browsing and prefer a minimal layout, with their photos and multimedia featured front and center. Mansion caters the photobloggers audience who love to just throw in the photographs they have and occasionally share their views as blog posts. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GraphPaperPress">Subscribe to Graph Paper Press' feed</a> or follow us on the bleeding edge of development by <a href="http://twitter.com/GraphPaperPress">following us on Twitter</a>.</p>

			<h3 class="fancy">Best Practices</h3>
			<p>If you want to make changes to how this theme looks and feels, then you should create a child theme.  Never make changes to the original theme files.  Why?  Because when a new version of this theme is released, all of your changes will be lost when you update.  Plus, making a child theme is incredibly easy. <a href="http://graphpaperpress.com/2010/02/10/how-to-create-child-themes-for-our-modularity-theme-for-wordpress/">Here is how you do it.</a></p>

			<h3 class="fancy">Installation</h3>
			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

			<h3 class="fancy">Installation Troubleshooting</h3>
			<p>If you've performed a clean install of Mansion and are having problems, make sure that the following conditions have been met:
			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				<li>Make sure that you've installed Mansion properly. You should use an FTP program like <a href="http://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>, <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a>, or <a href="http://fetchsoftworks.com/">Fetch</a> to upload your files. <strong>Do not</strong> use WordPress' <em>Install a theme in .zip format</em> option.</li>
				<li><strong>Permissions:</strong> On most servers, Mansion <strong>files</strong> should be set to <strong>644</strong> and <strong>folders</strong> should be set to <strong>755</strong>.</li>
				<li>Make sure that you've deactivated all of your plugins before installing and/or upgrading Mansion.</li>
				<li>Your Mansion folder should be named <strong>mansion</strong>. <strong>Do not rename</strong> this folder.</li>
				<li>If you are upgrading your version of Mansion, make sure to backup first and completely delete your old version of Mansion from your server before uploading the new version of Mansion to your server.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

			<h3 class="fancy">Initial Setup - Media settings</h3>
			<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
				<li>Click Settings -> Media.  Set your thumbnails to 200 x 150.  Set your medium photo size to 495 x 0.  Set your large size to 950 x 0.</li>
				<li>Set your external video embed width to 495. Leave the height blank. This applied for your YouTube or Vimeo links.</li>

				<li>This theme will automatically create thumbnails from the images that you upload, when you upload them.</li>
		</ol>
			<h6>IMPORTANT</h6>
			<p>If you are migrating from an old theme to a new theme and your thumbnails look squished or distorted, you might need to re-upload the image you plan on using for the post thumbnail.  This is because WordPress creates your image sizes based on the dimensions you specified above.  Old thumbnails will not be automatically resized.  You can also <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/" title="regenerate your thumbnails">regenerate your thumbnails</a> so that your old uploaded media have the new settings applied to it.</p>
			<p>By default, thumbnails are auto cropped by Wordpress.  This theme checks first to see if you have added the URL to your prefered thumbnail to custom field called, you guessed it, thumbnail.  If not, the theme will defer to the first photo that you uploaded using Wordpress' Add Photo icon.  If you haven't uploaded a photo using the Add Photo icon, the theme will can the post body for an image, and use it.  If no photo exists in the post body, the theme will use a default image.  As you can see, this series of "checks" allow you to have 100% control over your post thumnbnails.</p>

			<h3 class="fancy">Common problems</h3>
			<p>This theme uses jQuery javascript to do lots of fancy stuff.  If your theme looks broken, than you likely have a plugin that uses a conflicting javascript library.  Deactivate your plugins, one-by-one, to determine which plugin is conflicting with jQuery.</p>

			<h3 class="fancy">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
			<p><strong>How do we get the Big image as in the homepage of your demo site?</strong></p>
			<p>Tag your last post with "featured" tag and your image will automatically become big. Note it only happens for the last post.</p>
			<p><strong>How do we get that blog look as in the demo?</strong></p>
			<p>You will simply need to have a "blog" category and the blog archive page will automatically look like in the demo page. If you want to have other category also have this look, simply duplicate and rename the category-blog.php to category-catname.php where you will need to replace catname by your preferred category name.</p>
			<p><strong>Why am I not getting the array of image as in the demo homepage?</strong></p>
