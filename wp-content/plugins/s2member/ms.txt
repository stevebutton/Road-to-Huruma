= Is s2Member compatible with WordPress® 3.0+ Multisite Networking ? =
Yes. s2Member v3.2+, and also s2Member Pro, are BOTH compatible with Multisite Networking enabled. After you enable Multisite Networking, install the s2Member plugin. Then navigate to `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )` in the Dashboard on your ( Main Site ). You can get started now, by turning on [Multisite Networking](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) inside your installation of WordPress®.

= What about Multisite Networking ( WPMU ), used on a Blog Farm? =
Yes, preliminary ( experimental ) support for Multisite Blog Farms has also been implemented. If you're running a Multisite Blog Farm ( i.e. you offer Blogs ), please contact s2Member.com for further details. With Multisite Networking enabled, your site could ALSO offer a Customer access to create a Blog of their own, where a Customer becomes a "Member" of your ( Main Site ), and also a Blog Owner/Administrator. With s2Member installed ( network wide ), each of your Blog Owners could offer Membership too, using a single installation of the s2Member plugin ( which is a great selling point ). We refer to this as a Multisite Blog Farm.

You can get started now, by turning on [Multisite Networking](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network) inside your installation of WordPress®. Then, install the s2Member plugin ( network wide ). In the Dashboard for your Main Site, see: `s2Member -> Multisite ( Config )`. Before you go live, please contact [s2Member.com](http://www.s2member.com/contact/) for full documentation on Multisite Blog Farms. There is some additional functionality that can be enabled for security on a Blog Farm installation; and also some menus/documentation/functionality that can be disabled. NOTE ~ You will be asked to make a donation, or to purchase a Support Package for s2Member.
