A year later, National Woman&#8217;s Day was celebrated in the U.S. That prompted the first observance of International Women&#8217;s Day in March of 1911, with rallies demanding an end to discrimination, and that women be given the right to work, to vote and to hold public office.<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/votes-for-women-249x380.jpg\" alt=\"votes for women\" title=\"votes for women\" width=\"249\" height=\"380\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-8223\"\/><br \/>\nLater, that same month, on March 25th of 1911, the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire cut short the lives of more than 140 immigrant working girls in New York. Because that tragedy helped galvanize the labor movement&#8217;s fight to improve working conditions, it is still remembered on International Women&#8217;s Day.<\/p>\n<p>We commemorate the struggle and sacrifice of these women as we mark this 100th International Women&#8217;s Day and draw attention to the progress we have made and the work that lies ahead.<\/p>\n<p>Today, young women have more opportunities, access, and equality than ever before. In the United States, young women are now more likely than men to complete college and graduate school than men. But working women still earn less money and have a harder time supporting their families. Women are clustered in lower paying professions and are more likely to work part time, without health insurance or unemployment insurance.<\/p>\n<p>The DOL reports that women working full-time in the United States still make only about 78 cents on the dollar when compared to their male counterparts. For women of color, the wage gap is even greater &#8211; African-American women earn just 71 cents, and Latinas 62 cents, for each man&#8217;s dollar. The glass ceiling has been cracked but it is not broken.<\/p>\n<p>Globally, according to some estimates, women do two thirds of the work, but earn just one third of the income of men. Women are more likely than men to participate in precarious informal work with low pay, poor working conditions, and no protection under labor laws.<\/p>\n<p>We must achieve gender equality in the world of work so women have access to the same jobs, the same protections and same pay scales as their male counterparts. One solution is to prepare more women for careers in better paid professions, like science and technology. Women are underrepresented in these fields. That is one reason the United Nations theme for Women&#8217;s Day 2011 is &#8220;Equal access to education, training and science and technology: Pathway to decent work for women.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Let us work together to recognize the inequities that exist and bridge the gap in equal pay for equal work across the globe!<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. Department of Labor&#8217;s Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) will continue to promote gender equality through an array of global partnerships. We will work toward ratification of the International Labor Organization Convention 111 on non-discrimination in employment. In the upcoming Inter-American Conference of Ministers of Labor, (IACML) we and other governments will discuss ways to narrow the gender gap and integrate gender perspectives into employment policies throughout the Americas. We are making similar efforts in the G20, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and the OECD.<\/p>\n<p>In 1920, just two months before women achieved the right to vote, Congress created the DOL Women&#8217;s Bureau. It is the only Federal agency specifically mandated to improve the lives of working women. The Women&#8217;s Bureau continues to work towards Secretary Solis&#8217; goals including fair compensation for women and high quality work-life environments. The Women&#8217;s Bureau reaffirms its commitment to move women towards higher paying jobs in the non-traditional employment sectors such as Green, and Science Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). It is also committed to assisting women veterans who are experiencing homelessness reintegrate into the labor force.<\/p>\n<p>Through our continued resolve and collaborative efforts, we will improve the lives of women and their families and strengthen the future economic health of global communities. On this 100th International Women&#8217;s Day, as women and as workers, we give our thanks to those who came before us, and look forward to the next 100 years of progress toward gender equality in the world of work.<\/p>\n<p>______________________<br \/>\nThis post is co-authored by Sandra Polaski and Sara Manzano-Diaz.

I moved to D.C. not knowing anyone, and they quickly became almost like family. She was struggling to raise her baby by herself, hold down a full-time job and recover from years of substance abuse. I soon found myself following her into AA meetings in church basements in all-black neighborhoods. Marcus was the reason she got clean, and her reason to stay that way. <\/p>\n<p>I started to take the bus across town to pick up Marcus every other weekend so Adele could get a break on her road to recovery. With Marcus in a stroller, we explored D.C. \u2013 trips to the zoo, the park, children\u2019s museum, and <img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/Jamila-and-Marcus-269x380.jpg\" alt=\"Jamila and Marcus\" title=\"Jamila and Marcus\" width=\"269\" height=\"380\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-8212\"\/>swimming pools. Marcus batted cherry blossoms with his toddler fingers, erupting into convulsions of angel laughter as I shook the branches that sprinkled him with blossoms. He ran around the secret garden surrounded by the fortressed walls of the National Cathedral, completely protected from the rest of the world. When we weren\u2019t exploring the city, we loved just reading books and playing in my apartment. <\/p>\n<p>After rising rents pushed Adele and Marcus to another neighborhood across town, Adele began to relapse. I delivered pizza and toy frogs to their dark apartment in response to her call about domestic violence. As four-year-old Marcus emerged with a black eye, Adele showed me her bruises and told me how Marcus stepped in to try to protect her from dad. He threw Marcus out of the way with such force that Marcus ended up screaming until he vomited in the bathroom. Words like \u201cprotective order\u201d and \u201cchild abuse reporting\u201d flowed from my mouth only to be stuffed back again by Adele.<\/p>\n<p>Summer turned to fall, and childhood resumed. We made play-doh and comic strips, carved pumpkins and dressed up for Halloween. We caught fireflies that we would give names like \u201cShirley\u201d and \u201cEdwin\u201d as we made up stories about them while they glided around my apartment like blinking UFOs. I set up a little swimming pool for him in my front yard, took him to museums and we discovered his favorite pastime \u2013 going into the woods looking for bugs. <\/p>\n<p>One day, when Marcus was five, my friend Darla called me, crying. She had started spending time with Marcus too, quickly becoming as devoted to him as I was. One Saturday as she was on her way to pick up Marcus, Darla arrived at their house to find the U.S. Marshals dumping all of Adele\u2019s possessions on the curb. She scrambled to save what she could but lost nearly everything, even baby pictures of Marcus. After the eviction, Adele moved to Baltimore so she could escape her abuser and the people in her life who were still using drugs and alcohol.<\/p>\n<p>Adele sent Marcus to live with her mother in South Carolina while she went into treatment in Baltimore. I called him regularly to tell him silly bedtime stories about frogs that made him giggle until he dropped the phone. A year or so later, Adele got him back and I took the Greyhound and city buses to visit them in the drug treatment program from which she eventually graduated. The program helped her find a job and an apartment and so our personalized field trip program resumed. <\/p>\n<p>Our regular weekend adventures with Darla and I included his first trip to the beach, his first camping and fishing trips, regular pancake breakfasts and baseball in the park. Darla\u2019s boss donated a car to the family and pretty soon they were driving around inner-city Baltimore in a big fat Volvo freckled with NPR stickers and decals from a collection of eastern colleges.<\/p>\n<p>As Marcus grew older and the ghosts of unresolved trauma from his past haunted him, this child, he began to unravel. Around the age of nine, he smashed Darla\u2019s car window with a baseball bat and tried to walk straight into traffic. He violently bit the camp director at a week-long summer camp I got him into and tried to run away down the dusty tree-lined country road. They had to hospitalize Marcus in a rural Virginia hospital for being a threat to self and others as he tried to bite himself and anyone who came close to him in the camp infirmary. <\/p>\n<p>I felt like a failure, naively thinking that because he loved so much being in nature, that immersing him in that environment and exposing him to new experiences would take care of him. The interventions of \u201clove\u201d and \u201copportunities\u201d that I knew \u2013 were not enough.<\/p>\n<p>His mother was having trouble with him at home too and he got expelled from the Baltimore public school system, (which is not an easy feat). He got medicated, was repeatedly hospitalized for his outbursts, and eventually accumulated a rap sheet of diagnoses that landed him in a residential school for children with emotional disturbances. By the age of ten, Marcus was largely imprisoned like his father. <\/p>\n<p>We visited him there once, as he stood, a handsome eleven-year-old, not sure whether to hug us or let us go. I was caught between the boundary of bearing witness to a life and the compulsion to save it. Between wanting to rescue and the kind of commitment Marian Wright Edelman talks about not to give up on any child. <\/p>\n<p>Five years elapsed; my birthday cards went unanswered and phone numbers changed. I tried not to think about Marcus much. To me, he represented my failure to overcome all of his disadvantages, despite my efforts to give him love and new experiences. <\/p>\n<p>This past Christmas, 2010, I was sitting by the fireplace and up popped a Facebook message from someone with the same last name as Marcus, but with the first name as Savage. With a dog named Cocaine: <\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cHey jamila it\u2019s me marcus how you been doing im been trying to find yall on Facebook but i see I found u so how life been treating u and how is darla\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Marcus\u2019 Facebook wall was littered with the language of an urban teenager. His pictures showed poses like a grown man, his chest covered in tats, his face in menacing contortions. There were postings about getting kicked out of school and wanting to kill \u201cdis bitch\u201d and not wanting to be \u201cin this life no more.\u201d Is this what happens when a child of promise turns into a wayward teen? Then Darla pointed out that in the background of one of the pictures, was a painting I made him for his 8th birthday that said \u201cMarcus: Herpetologist,\u201d an homage to his early determination to learn everything there was to learn about reptiles. <\/p>\n<p>It was time for a reunion. To arrange the meeting, we talked on the phone \u2013 his voice was deep, his vocabulary \u2013 street. There was a flicker of warmth in his voice. So we set a date for me to visit them in Baltimore. I was scared of what I would find, of how unrecognizable this Facebook persona was. Was he mad at me for \u201cabandoning\u201d him? I was afraid to look him in the face and see how bad things had gotten. We texted our location like the final clues along the way of a scavenger hunt that took five years to complete.<\/p>\n<p>Marcus and Adele met me at the train station. There was the same little face I knew, framed in the car window, not sure whether to smile or freeze. Adele got out and bear hugged me, that same hug that held me tight when I first moved to D.C. and knew not a soul. Her face looked the same, just a little more worn from life, but still shiny, vibrant and toothless. Her two little dogs bounced out of the car and circled us like static balloons. <\/p>\n<p>Marcus rose from the car, towering over me, with a scar across his eyebrows and a limp in his gait. He hugged me and smiled shyly like teenagers do at family reunions. He told me that he needed to stop by the pet store to pick up some food for his reptiles. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cHere, Jamila, you take the front seat.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Marcus took the dogs with him in the back seat and showed me the carrier filled with their puppies, writhing in a little ball of moist puppyness. I could not stop smiling, feeling instantly transported to fifteen years ago when I was driving around with Adele and Marcus in the much smaller, raggedy car when it was too hot for him to wear more than a diaper.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJamila, do you still live in that same house?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He peppered me with questions from the back seat like a little boy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDo you still work at the school? Where is Darla?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The questions kept coming as we bumped along the street, as if he had all of them lined up in his head in case we might meet again. Adele navigated traffic as deftly as she did her teenage son\u2019s complaints about the new school she planned to send him to.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat my mom doesn\u2019t seem to understand is I don\u2019t want to go to an all-boys\u2019 school,\u201d Marcus protested, in between describing all of the intriguing programs they offer. Adele just kept responding with the authority of a mother who knows what\u2019s best for her son. A mom who has been through so much, and has not given up trying. A woman who may be functionally illiterate, but still manages to keep her job, home, car and raise her son. There was nothing he could say that would rattle her cage; her mind was made up, and that was that.<\/p>\n<p>We arrived at the crumbling row house on a dimly lit block, and Marcus led me downstairs to the \u201creptile room.\u201d I gasped at the sight of two enormous calico pythons, curled up in huge spirals like a huge rope. They sat in their own glass aquariums under the gaze of a bare light bulb dangling, with plywood and dumbbell weights on top. He had other snakes and lizards in smaller aquariums and shallow, plastic clothing bins with air holes poked on top.<\/p>\n<p>He explained to me where his female python was in her ovulatory cycle, why her last eggs were infertile, why each scar was there, and the exact time he would need to feed them live rats next. He talked about the value of each snake, his plans to breed and sell them, and the invention he has in the works to build and sell better reptilian cages. <\/p>\n<p>We headed out to his restaurant of choice and settled into a booth with burgers and fries. Marcus noticed that bacon is missing from his bacon cheeseburger, but he didn\u2019t want to get his order corrected. He wanted to talk. <\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when we went camping and we saw that lady swimming naked?\u201d he laughed.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when we went to that cabin in the woods and tried to go ice fishing?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when we caught those fireflies and let them fly all over your apartment?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when we went to that haunted house and I wanted you to carry me?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when you were dog-sitting and the dog ran away from us into the park?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when we went to that castle place and made a cake for my birthday?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRemember when we went to that reptile festival at the Smithsonian?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He remembered everything.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd when you all went fishing and he caught the biggest catfish on record,\u201d Adele added. Oh, he talks about y\u2019all all the time.\u201d Adele smiled, recounting details of stories Marcus had relayed to her over and over throughout the years. \u201cHe ain\u2019t never forget what you all did with him. He got to experience so many things, you all took him everywhere. That\u2019s what I tell him, all those people loved you. That\u2019s a whole lot of love in you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>I did not expect to feel the strange sense of satisfaction that I did going home after meeting fifteen-year-old Marcus. All I had known was Marcus the baby and the boy, and I suppose there was a part of me that wrote him off, the way we do when babies grow up, talk back or hit back. The pre-adolescent and adolescent phase of life is not always pretty, but after all he had been through, he was a good kid. Marcus was taking care of a menagerie of animals, keeping up with their feeding and mating schedule like a scientist at a zoo. He found a way to follow his dreams, not waiting for the perfect age, perfect family, or perfect school to do it. <\/p>\n<p>Marcus has almost survived his childhood, dreams intact. I don\u2019t know if Marcus will go to college; he is struggling enough with high school. I called him after his first day at the boy\u2019s school; he said it\u2019s a scary place filled with criminals, so his mom is searching for another alternative. The cradle-to-prison pipeline still lurks, ready to take him at any time like so many young people walking the tightrope between disadvantage and opportunity. <\/p>\n<p>Fortifying a child\u2019s resilience requires creative schools that are not one-size-fits all, innovative after-school programs that are more exciting than the streets, and opportunities to build caring relationships with mentors. Our role sometimes is to plant seeds that can sprout for years, even generations later. We don\u2019t get to see most of those seeds sprout. All we can do is recognize an opportunity when we see it, give what love and support we can, and trust that the little soul will find their way.<\/p>\n<p>________________________________________________________________________<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/Jamila-and-Lars-128x192.jpg\" alt=\"Jamila and Lars\" title=\"Jamila and Lars\" width=\"128\" height=\"192\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-3855\"\/>Jamila Larson is a licensed independent, clinical social worker with fourteen years of experience working in Washington DC.

And in many other ways, modern-day slavery looks much the same as it did millennia ago. <\/p>\n<p><em>Five Thousand Years of Slavery<\/em> uses the words of slaves, slave owners, and witnesses to tell the sordid story of human bondage from as early as Sumerian times, when warriors were captured and presented to the king as his slaves, to the present. The accounts show that the lives of modern-day slaves often have parallels in the past. <\/p>\n<p>For example, the words of Francisco Datini in fourteenth-century Florence, requesting a \u201cslave-girl, young and sturdy and of good stock, strong \u2026 to wash the dishes and carry the wood and bread to the oven,\u201d could have been spoken by a slave owner in today\u2019s Mauritania, where enslaved women cook, clean, and raise their masters\u2019 children \u2014 their own children having been sold away. <\/p>\n<p>Similarly, the story of the slave Patricius, captured from Roman Britain in the year 390, closely resembles the tale told to us by Francis, who was born in Sudan. The fifteen-year-old Patricius was nabbed from his family\u2019s estate and taken to Ireland, where he tended sheep alone day after day and prayed. Five years later, he escaped and found his way back to Britain. <\/p>\n<p>We begin our book <em>Five Thousand Years of Slavery<\/em> with Francis Bok\u2019s story. At age seven, he was sent by his mother to the marketplace to sell hard-cooked eggs and peanuts, with only the older village children to watch out for him. He was excited because this was the first time he was given this responsibility. But suddenly the mood of the market changed, and he saw smoke rising from a nearby village. Armed men on horseback galloped into the market. They killed many people and set fire to the village. One of the riders grabbed Francis, dropped him into a basket tied to a donkey\u2019s back, and rode off with him. The little boy was carried north, where he was sold to a man named Giemma, a cattleherder. He would be his cowherd for ten years.<\/p>\n<p>Britain\u2019s Patricius would later become Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland, whose story speaks poignantly of the cruelty of child slavery. And Francis would become an eloquent modern abolitionist, who now lives in Massachusetts and has even addressed Congress about modern slavery in Sudan.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8177\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width:215px;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/Snapshot-2011-03-01-13-18-12-205x192.jpg\" alt=\"Francis Bok\" title=\"\" width=\"205\" height=\"192\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8177\"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Francis Bok<\/p><\/div>\n<p>To see Francis, you wouldn\u2019t know he was a survivor of slavery. He will impress you with his dignified manner, his thoughtful and soft-spoken speech, and his ability to remain calm no matter the questions. Yet until he escaped, he was treated like a beast and even made to sleep with animals. \u201cI was trained by being woken up early in the morning, about four or five,\u201d he told us. \u201cUsually I had to take the cattle to the nearby forest to feed them, and then I would bring them back for milking. I would return to the fields until it was dark, when I would go back to the house to do domestic things until everyone else had gone to bed. Only then could I go to sleep. I got used to waking myself up early in the morning. Even if my body was not ready to get up, I had to force it to do so; otherwise I\u2019d be beaten or threatened.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No matter how sick or tired he was, Francis did the job. \u201cThat is the purpose for which they had brought us there,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a slave, you\u2019re a slave. \u2026 You don\u2019t have any freedom to reject anything except that you have to go with what is told to you to do by the master.\u201d <\/p>\n<p>When he was 17, Francis succeeded in escaping. He has written an account of his ordeal, <em>Escape from Slavery<\/em> (by Francis Bok, published by St. Martin\u2019s Griffin), and is raising money to build a school in his former village. Painful as it is to talk about his experiences, he told us he is \u201cdoing it on behalf of millions\u201d \u2014 the enslaved who cannot fight for themselves. <\/p>\n<p>Similarly, James Kofi Annan, a former slave in Ghana, is fighting for those unable to help themselves. Impoverished Ghanaian parents often see no option but to sell their children into bondage, expecting it to be for a short time. Annan was one of those young children forced to work on Lake Volta for a fisherman. The youngest of these slaves spend tedious hours bailing water from boats, while older children dive into the water to untangle nets \u2013 and sometimes get caught in them and strangled to death. Children of all ages are at risk of sexual abuse. Annan escaped and through courage, determination, and hard work succeeded in gaining an education and employment with a financial institution. Haunted by his childhood misery and the knowledge that youngsters were still being brutalized, he left a prestigious career to devote himself full-time to rescuing and educating them. When we spoke, he said people ask him how he could have left his job, but he didn\u2019t see how he could stay while children were suffering as he had been. He established the organization <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.challengingheights.org\/\">Challenging Heights<\/a><\/strong> to help them.<\/p>\n<p>Our book <em>Five Thousand Years of Slavery<\/em> explores the best and worst in human society throughout time.

The courageous voices of people like Clarkson in the past and James Kofi Annan and Francis Bok today give us hope that together, we can finally \u201csee these calamities to their end,\u201d everywhere on earth.<\/p>\n<p>___________________________________<\/p>\n<p>Marjorie Gann and Janet Willen\u2019s new book, Five Thousand Years of Slavery (Tundra Books), is available through <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.tundrabooks.com\/catalog\/display.pperl?isbn=9780887769146\"><strong>tundrabooks.com<\/strong><\/a>.

Though she was only 12 years old, Mbithe, who comes from Mbooni in Machakos, was able to understand that her father was succumbing to HIV\/AIDS.<\/p>\n<p>But she had not only expected that immediately after he was laid to rest, her mother would take his position at the deathbed.<\/p>\n<p>Being the first born in a family of nine, it was upon her to watch over her dying mother and look after her eight siblings. Last year, when she was in standard eight, her mother lost her fight to the angel of death, turning her children into orphans.<\/p>\n<p>The nine children then had to rely on their aging grandmother, who was also taking care of five other orphans left behind by Mbithe&#8217;s aunt, who also died of Aids &#8211; related illnesses.<\/p>\n<p>After the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education results were out, Mbithe had scored 335 marks and was invited to join Mbooni Girl&#8217;s Secondary but could not enroll due to financial constraints.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I stayed at home as my colleagues; most of whom I had beaten in KCPE, joined form one. I tried to do anything to keep us going. I fetched water for neighbors and worked in their farms for payment. Then came a woman from our village that lives in Nairobi. She invited me to go with her. She told me that she would employ me as a charcoal seller&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;On reaching Nairobi, the woman did not live to her word. After a week she told me to do what other girls were doing. She wanted me to be a prostitute but I refused. She put pressure on me and finally threw me out of her house. It\u2019s when I went to Child Aid Organization Kenya for help. They liaised with the Children\u2019s Department and I was placed in a Charitable Children\u2019s Home&#8221;. She says.<\/p>\n<p>Mbithe&#8217;s case is not unique. Kaceri* 16 year old girl arrived in Nairobi two years ago from her rural home at the behest of her father and uncle. She was forced to abandon school to seek odd jobs to support her ailing parents and siblings.<br \/>\n<div id=\"attachment_8160\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width:303px;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/0217ROR7101-293x192.jpg\" alt=\"on the street in Nairobi\" title=\"photo: Steve Button\" width=\"293\" height=\"192\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8160\"\/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">on the street in Nairobi<\/p><\/div><br \/>\nThese girls like many others whose stories have not been told, find themselves in the city without a place to stay; and in return, out of frustrations and deceit, they are forced to engage in transactional sex with older men for survival. The outcomes are heartrending. At the very least they became pregnant. If they don\u2019t abort; after giving birth they abandon or damp their children\u2026worse if they get infected with HIV and slowly, like their parents, succumb to the angel of death. \n<p>Mbithe and Kaceri&#8217;s story is not different from other children I interviewed. Like these two, they too, recounted dramatic and in some cases, almost unimaginable abuse of their rights after they were trafficked into prostitution. Many said that trading sex was difficult to avoid if girls wanted to survive or to help at home (as domestic workers). &#8220;After my mother died, I went to my grandmother. In a year\u2019s time, my grandmother died, so I stopped school&#8230; then we went to my aunt, my mom&#8217;s younger sister&#8230; Most girls find that they start having sex with stepfathers or uncles. Most are raped. They have no say. So they keep quite.&#8221; said one girl in Dandora, Nairobi.<\/p>\n<p>Girls and boys are both victims of violence in most parts of Kenya, but girls in most families are the first to be withdrawn from school when families cannot pay school fees or need extra source of income. Girls are also more likely to find that the work to which they are sent, even if it is not sex work, puts them at risk of sexual abuse. <\/p>\n<p>Mbithe and Kaceri were lucky because they got help. Mbithe was able to continue with her secondary school education and Kaceri got skills training in tailoring and dress-making. She was also later reunited with her son whom she had dumped at an old lady\u2019s doorsteps. However, the plight of millions of other Kenyan children who have lost their parents to HIV and AIDS or whose parents or main caregivers are ill with the disease is one of the gravest humanitarian crises in our history. Recent statistics by the National Aids Control Council indicates over 1 million children have been orphaned by HIV &#038; AIDS and the number is on the rise.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/0222ROR412-Web1-289x192.jpg\" alt=\"Photo: U. R. Romano\" title=\"Photo: U. R. Romano\" width=\"289\" height=\"192\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-8162\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Orphans and vulnerable children face a wide range of human rights abuses, with trafficking topping the list. Because AIDS in the household often pushes families deeper into poverty, due to medical care needs, difficulty of replacing lost earnings of an ill bread &#8211; winner, and eventually, funeral expenses, orphaned children are more vulnerable to trafficking and risks associated with hazardous laborer than others.<\/p>\n<p>The subordinate status of women and girls in our society and the intransigent poverty that seems to fall first and most heavily on women and girls often conspire to force them into hazardous working situations that expose them to sexual abuse with attendant risks of HIV infection.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Both boys &#038; girls are trafficked in many parts of Kenya but girls in most families are the first to be withdrawn from school&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>How much longer are we going to deny that violence against children is a serious societal problem and that children are the main sufferers? Isn&#8217;t it time we at least consider taking sexual behavior out of these rigid religious and cultural contexts that it is now in and take a more practical approach and thus solve the sufferings that these children\u2019s case studies highlight?<\/p>\n<p>____________________________________<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/child-aid-org-kenya.jpg\" alt=\"child aid org kenya\" title=\"child aid org kenya\" width=\"165\" height=\"66\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-7717\"\/>My name is Omwenga Tom Nyang&#8217;au.

The prickliness of humans who are just coming into their own as emerging adults makes it difficult to reach them at the same time as they most desperately need guidance and support. This is equally true on the global as on the individual level. <span id=\"more-8094\"><\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;In Brazil, more adolescents die from violence than do children under five from disease and ill health. Global net attendance for secondary school is roughly one third lower than for primary school. Worldwide, one third of all new HIV cases involve young people aged 15-24. And in the developing world, excluding China, 1 in every 3 girls gets married before the age of 18.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it&#8217;s pointless to support only the youngest among poor children, if they then fall into a black hole of neglect once they hit their teenage years. <\/p>\n<p>April Thompson of <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.goodweave.org\/home.php\">GoodWeave<\/a><\/strong> brings us <em><strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=8026\">From Slave to Student<\/a><\/strong><\/em>, an article about Narayan, who spent eight years of his life laboring at a carpet loom in Nepal, a victim of debt peonage. Since being rescued, Narayan has excelled in school and looks back on the nightmarish time of his earlier childhood as a &#8220;dark age.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Just as a reminder that the benefit of eliminating child labor extends beyond the individual victim to the entire community and nation, we have a report issued by Stop Child Labour, <strong><em><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=7938\">Let Parents Earn and Children Learn<\/a><\/em><\/strong>, which focuses on several case studies of trade union efforts to combat child labor. For example, in the cottonseed industry in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, the writers compared the wages of adult workers in villages in which children had been removed from the labor force with villages where child labor was still prevalent. The results are remarkably unambiguous. Where there were no children working, the average wage for adults was more than 150% higher. <\/p>\n<p>We also have a road map for companies to follow to make sure that supply chains are child labor-free, <em><strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=7946\">Out of Work and Into School<\/a><\/strong><\/em>, also issued by Stop Child Labour.<\/p>\n<p>Another initiative by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) started out by targeting adolescent AIDS orphans in Mozambique in 2005. We have a film, <em><strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=8020\">Harvesting for Life<\/a><\/strong><\/em>, profiling the Junior Farmer Field and Life School, that aims to teach agriculture and life skills to teens who have no parents to fall back on. The program was extremely successful, so much so that JFFLS programs have been started in numerous countries, including Burundi, Cameroon, DRC, Ghana, Gaza &#038; West Bank, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia, Nepal, Rwanda, Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. <\/p>\n<p>The JFFLS program in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip specifically addresses the challenges to food production in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. 70% of households in the Gaza Strip have limited access to food and require food aid since the last Israel operation. Much of the land formerly available for agriculture in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is inaccessible due to the security barrier. In <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=8071\">a case study<\/a><\/strong>, we see that Palestinian adolescents, both girls and boys, learned to make multi-story kitchen gardens and sack gardens to grow food for themselves and their families. <\/p>\n<p>Finally we have a report issued by Human Rights Watch, <em><strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=8085\">Failing its Families: Lack of Paid Leave and Work-Family Supports in the US<\/a><\/strong><\/em>. The sobering conclusion of this report is that despite the widespread embrace of so-called &#8220;family values,&#8221; the United States is far from family-friendly in the legislative protections extended to working parents. In most states, it is left up to the employer whether or not to grant paid leave when a baby is born, and, unsurprisingly, most employers do not. A cascading series of negative effects on child health is the result &#8211; mothers under pressure to return to work postpone medical appointments, give up on breastfeeding and suffer from postpartum depression. Responding to the participation of women in the workforce with family-friendly policies could do much to improve child mortality statistics in the United States. Just as a for instance:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u2022 A study of 16 European countries from 1969 to 1994 found that a 50-week entitlement to paid parental leave was associated with about a 20 percent decline in post-neonatal deaths and a 15 percent drop in fatalities between ages one and five.<br \/>\n\u2022 A 2010 study found that the US could prevent the deaths of nearly 900 infants and save $13 billion dollars per year if 90 percent of mothers breastfed exclusively for their babies\u2019 first six months of life.

For eight years of his early life, Narayan was a bonded child laborer without access to education, toiling up to fifteen hours a day.<span id=\"more-8026\"><\/span> <\/p>\n<p>Now a bright, friendly high school student at one of Nepal&#8217;s most prestigious private schools, Narayan is an articulate student and a natural leader. Narayan was rescued from the factory by the nonprofit organization <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.goodweave.org\/home.php\">GoodWeave<\/a><\/strong>, which works to eradicate exploitative child labor from South Asia\u2019s rug industry and provide educational opportunities for these young children.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBecause of GoodWeave, now I have a pen in my hand instead of working tools, knowledge in my mind and confidence towards life,\u201d says the student. Narayan\u2019s friends from GoodWeave\u2019s rehabilitation <img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/Narayan-older.jpg\" alt=\"Narayan older\" title=\"Narayan older\" width=\"214\" height=\"268\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-8048\"\/>center \u201cthink of their time as child laborers in the carpet industry as the dark age of their life. Now they really understand the power of confidence and dignity in life, and they know they deserve these things,\u201d he explains. <\/p>\n<p>GoodWeave\u2019s new One in a Million campaign was inspired by the one million children who, like Narayan, were illegally working in the carpet-making industry when GoodWeave began in 1994. The campaign seeks to create awareness and build demand for the handmade rugs GoodWeave certifies as child-labor-free, ultimately eliminating this \u201cdark age\u201d practice from the industry. <\/p>\n<p>Through the GoodWeave certification program, local inspectors in Nepal and India visit licensed manufacturers on a surprise, random basis. Companies that join GoodWeave and meet its strict no-child-labor standards are issued GoodWeave labels for their carpets, each bearing a unique, traceable number. When inspectors do find children working at the looms, they are rescued and provided free schooling, room and board, and counseling, among other critical services.<\/p>\n<p>GoodWeave works to not only get children off the looms and back into schools, but otherwise help families overcome the barriers that keep them from putting and keeping their children from school. For example, the organization also sponsors education for children found to be at risk for carpet work, and provides daycare for the children of adult weavers to help prevent their children from ending up on the looms. Since GoodWeave\u2019s founding in 1994, child labor in South Asia\u2019s rug industry is down 75 percent, to an estimated 250,000.<\/p>\n<p>By seeking out GoodWeave certified rugs, consumers can use their purchasing power help bring the number of child weavers to zero. And given the precarious state of the rug industry, rug buyers have more leverage than ever in the marketplace. From 2007 to 2010, the U.S. market for imported handmade rugs dropped a record 46 percent, as consumers bought fewer and cheaper rugs. Meanwhile, the price of key materials, such as high-quality Himalayan wool, is soaring. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/www.mediavoicesforchildren.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/\/Indian-Child-Weaver-255x380.jpg\" alt=\"Indian Child Weaver\" title=\"Indian Child Weaver\" width=\"255\" height=\"380\" class=\"alignleft size-large wp-image-8051\"\/>In such dire market conditions, rug companies could easily be tempted to employ children (who typically earn a fraction of an adult wage) to lower prices and boost profits. And it\u2019s even easier for companies to justify cutting corners by skimping on third-party inspections and monitoring services. Yet without the rigorous system of checks and balances provided by an independent organization like GoodWeave, the exploitation of children will remain in the shadows, far from view of not only consumers but often even the companies selling the rugs themselves. <\/p>\n<p>Companies can do the right thing by becoming members of GoodWeave\u2019s certification program, ensuring that the rugs they produce and sell are child-labor-free. While GoodWeave\u2019s low company membership fees help to pay for inspections and social programs for weaving communities, on average, the fees are typically the equivalent of just a few dollars on the cost of each rug, and don\u2019t come close to covering the full of its operations in Nepal and India. As a result, GoodWeave relies on donations for much of its funding. <\/p>\n<p>Consumers can incentivize companies to do the right thing by only buying handmade rugs that bear the GoodWeave label. Their purchase sends a signal down the supply chain that a child\u2019s life is more valuable than a few dollars\u2019 bargain. A GoodWeave certified rug is truly one in a million, not only because of its handmade beauty will last a lifetime, but also because its purchase helps kids like Narayan enjoy the life of freedom that every child deserves. <\/p>\n<p>Read the rest of Narayan\u2019s story <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.goodweave.org\/story_detail.php?cid=15&#038;story_id=6\">here<\/a><\/strong>, or click <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.goodweave.org\/child_labor_campaign\/about\">here<\/a><\/strong> to subscribe to GoodWeave\u2019s free newsletter and learn more about GoodWeave\u2019s One in a Million campaign. <\/p>","title":"From Slave to Student, Narayan is One in a Million","category":["GoodWeave","Viewpoint","access to education","child labor","Nepal"],"guid":{"isPermaLink":"false","content":"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=8026"},"pubDate":"Thu, 24 Feb 2011 18:43:09 +0000","y:published":{"hour":"18","timezone":"UTC","second":"9","month":"2","minute":"43","utime":"1298572989","day":"24","day_of_week":"4","year":"2011"}},{"link":"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=7965","y:id":{"value":"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?p=7965","permalink":"false"},"slash:comments":"0","wfw:commentRss":"http:\/\/mediavoicesforchildren.org\/?feed=rss2&p=7965","description":"This week at Media Voices, we have an article by Mari Marcel Thekaekara, a wonderful writer who has made caste discrimination against the Dalits her particular focus.

One of the more chilling sequences comes as an upper-caste landlord describes how common it used to be for people (other people, to be sure) to rape a Dalit woman if they came across her when no one else was around. He doesn&#8217;t actually say that he did this himself, but his chuckle certainly makes you wonder. <\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve read a number of Mari Marcel Thekaekara&#8217;s articles on <strong><a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/infochangeindia.org\/\">InfoChange<\/a><\/strong>.

Economic growth has done little to improve the Dalits' lot; despite legislation, they still form 60 per cent of all those below the poverty line.

Thekaekara is a professional journalist on social issues and a media campaigner on the rights of Adivasi, Dalits and other disadvantaged groups. She has written in national and international magazines and newspapers as well as on websites which include The Hindu, Statesman, Times of India, Indian Express, Frontline, Economic and Political Weekly, Hindustan Times, Seminar, Infochange, New Internationalist and The Guardian. Mari Marcel Thekaekara has written extensively on the issue of Dalit human rights, including the (violation of) rights of Dalit women, for e.g. the National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights, Action Aid, Christian Aid and the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative.
