				<h2>Lots of information</h2>

				<p>
					On the incidents of our precipitate flight from that horrible place--on
					the extinction of all human sentiment in that tumultuous, mad scramble
					up the damp and mouldy stairs--slipping, falling, pulling one another
					down and clambering over one another's back--the lights extinguished,
					babes trampled beneath the feet of their strong brothers and hurled
					backward to death by a mother's arm!--on all this I do not dare to
					dwell.
				</p>
				<p>
					My mother, my eldest brother and sister and I escaped; the others
					remained below, to perish of their wounds, or of their terror--some,
					perhaps, by flame. For within an hour we four, hastily gathering
					together what money and jewels we had and what clothing we could carry,
					fired the dwelling and fled by its light into the hills.
					We did not even
					pause to collect the insurance, and my dear mother said on her
					death-bed, years afterward in a distant land, that this was the only sin
					of omission that lay upon her conscience. Her confessor, a holy man,
					assured her that under the circumstances Heaven would pardon the
					neglect.

					All was clear. My father, whatever had caused him to be "taken bad" at
					his meal (and I think my sainted mother could have thrown some light
					upon that matter) had indubitably been buried alive. The grave having
					been accidentally dug above the forgotten drain, and down almost to the
					crown of its arch, and no coffin having been used, his struggles on
					reviving had broken the rotten masonry and he had fallen through,
					escaping finally into the cellar. Feeling that he was not welcome in his
					own house, yet having no other, he had lived in subterranean seclusion,
					a witness to our thrift and a pensioner on our providence.

					It was he who
					had eaten our food; it was he who had drunk our wine--he was no better
					than a thief! In a moment of intoxication, and feeling, no doubt, that
					need of companionship which is the one sympathetic link between a
					drunken man and his race, he had left his place of concealment at a
					strangely inopportune time, entailing the most deplorable consequences
					upon those nearest and dearest to him--a blunder that had almost the
					dignity of crime.
